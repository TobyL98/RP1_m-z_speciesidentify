# Sequence Based Species Identification of ZooMS Peptide Mass Fingerprints 

## Overview
This project uses Collagen 1 sequence data downloaded from databases (e.g., NCBI protein) to semi-automate the identification process of Zoo Archaelology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) Peptide Mass Fingerprint (PMF) data. In order to do this there are two pipeline for this process:
1. Theoretical peptide m/z values are generated from COL1α1 and COL1α2 sequences generated from
