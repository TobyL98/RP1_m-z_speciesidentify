# Generating the LCMSMS Rules from the LCMSMS Mascot Data files
## Overview
This code uses the LCMSMS data from multiple species for COL1 and groups the data by peptides that are in the same position in the sequence in different species.
The code uses these grouops to work out the likely number of oxidations and demidations for each group of peptides. The output can subsequently be used to filter the possible PTMs
in the theoretical peptides pipeline
