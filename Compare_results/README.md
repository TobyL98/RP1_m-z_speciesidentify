# Comparing the experimental ZooMS m/z values to the species theoretical m/z values
## Overview
This code compares the m/z values from an experimental ZooMS spectra to the theoretical m/z values that have been generated for a variety of species in the theoretical_peptides_pipeline.
There is a match if the m/z value from the experimental spectra is within a certain threshold (e.g., +- 0.2) of the theoretical m/z value. The species with the most matches is most closely
related to the experimental spectra.
